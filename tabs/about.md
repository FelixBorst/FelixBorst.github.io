My name is Felix Borst and I am currently working as a Premier Field Engineer for Microsoft.  

I started learning Azure in 2017 and started off scripting with PowerShell at roughly the same time.  

Right now I am still focusing on automating things, be it an Application Deployment or an Infrastructure setup. 

My most loved and used tools are PowerShell (5 & 7), Visual Studio Code and Azure DevOps Release Pipelines.  

If you have any questions to one of my blog posts or just want to chat, feel free to hit me up :)
